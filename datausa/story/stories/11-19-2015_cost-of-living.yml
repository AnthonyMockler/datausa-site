    description: "Many believe that women are underrepresented at the top because they drop off the corporate ladder. The study shows that, in fact, women leave at most levels at a lower rate than men. But they advance from one level to the next more slowly than men. Many continue to believe that women generally do not aspire to top positions. The study shows that women at every level desire to be top executives, but at a lower rate than their male counterparts. (The gap gets larger toward the top.)"
