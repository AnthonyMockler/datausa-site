<!-- <p>Learn the full story of how the DataUSA platform was made and its goals of delivering trusted and intuitive insights about US economic data to inform citizens, policy makers and business leaders.</p> -->
<article>
  <section>
    <p>In 2014, Deloitte, Datawheel, and Cesar Hidalgo, Professor at the MIT Media Lab and Director of MacroConnections, came together to embark on an ambitious journey -- to understand and visualize the critical issues facing the United States in areas like jobs, skills and education across industry and geography. And, to use this knowledge to inform decision making among executives, policymakers and citizens.</p>
    <p>Our team, comprised of economists, data scientists, designers, researchers and business executives, worked for over a year with input from policymakers, government officials and everyday citizens to develop DataUSA, the most comprehensive website and visualization engine of public US Government data. DataUSA tells millions of stories about America. Through advanced data analytics and visualization, it tells stories about: places in America—towns, cities and states; occupations, from teachers to welders to web developers; industries--where they are thriving, where they are declining and their interconnectedness to each other; and education and skills, from where is the best place to live if you’re a computer science major to the key skills needed to be an accountant.</p>
    <p>DataUSA puts public US Government data in your hands. Instead of searching through multiple data sources that are often incomplete and difficult to access, you can simply point to DataUSA to answer your questions. DataUSA provides an open, easy-to-use platform that turns data into knowledge. It allows millions of people to conduct their own analyses and create their own stories about America – its people, places, industries, skill sets and educational institutions. Ultimately, accelerating society’s ability to learn and better understand itself.</p>
    <p>How can DataUSA be useful? If you are an executive, it can help you better understand your customers and talent pool. It can inform decisions on where to open or relocate your business or plant.  You may also want to build on the DataUSA platform using the API and integrate additional data. If you are a recent college graduate, DataUSA can help you find locations with the greatest opportunities for the job you want and the major you have. If you are a policymaker, DataUSA can be a powerful input to economic and workforce development programs. Or, you may be a public health professional and want to dive into behavioral disease patterns across the country. These are just a few examples of how an open data platform like DataUSA can benefit everyday citizens, business and government.</p>
